# Czo System Rescue

## Czo System Rescue, a Linux Arch with ZFS

This is my fork of [SystemRescue](https://www.system-rescue.org/) with ZFS.

It's a SystemRescue with zfs binaries + 3ware raid + my configuration files.

Xfce has its whisker menu and its xfce4-xkb plugin. There is also firefox (no-esr) and firefox-ublock-origin.

It works on amd64.

Version 820 (from 2023) contains kernel/6.3.8-arch1-1 and zfs/2.1.12-1

Versions 241 (from 2011) and 492 (from 2017), are based on Gentoo without zfs, but run on x86.
