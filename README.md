# Czo System Rescue

## Czo System Rescue, a Linux Arch with ZFS

This is my fork of [SystemRescue](https://www.system-rescue.org/) with ZFS.

It's a SystemRescue with zfs binaries + 3ware raid + my configuration files.

Xfce has its whisker menu and its xfce4-xkb plugin. There is also firefox (no-esr) and firefox-ublock-origin.

It works on amd64.

Version 811 contains kernel/5.15.86-1-lts and zfs/2.1.7

The 241 version, which dates from 2011, is based on Gentoo without zfs, but works on x86.
