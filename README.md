# Czo Rescue Arch

## Czo Rescue Arch with ZFS

This is my fork of [SystemRescue](https://www.system-rescue.org/) with ZFS.

https://gitlab.com/czo/czo-rescue-arch

It's a SystemRescue with zfs binaries + 3ware raid +
my configuration files.

Xfce has its whisker menu and its xfce4-xkb plugin. There
is also firefox (no-esr) and firefox-ublock-origin.

It works on amd64.

Version 811 contains kernel/5.15.86-1-lts and zfs/2.1.7
